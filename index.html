        <h2>A brief introduction to me and my journey:</h2>
           <p>
            My career history is quite obscure, for the first 18 years 
            of my life my aspirations were to become a professional 
            footballer and make my professional debut, at 17 years old
            i achieved this, however i think my proudest moment would be
            recovering and rehabilitating a ruptered ACL, MCL and meniscus injury
            and returning to a high level after. It was the most challenging, 
            yet necessery time of adversity i have had to face and taught
            me how to use hard times it to become better, a skill i value massively.

                This is when i suffered the injuries i did, these included the ACL,
                MCL and meniscus ruptures in my left knee which required surgery, i 
                dedicated 8-9 months to physio and rehabilition to return to proffesional
                football, i returned and played at that level for around 4 months before 
                suffering a dislocation on my other knee which required another surgery, 
                however this had some complications with the regrowth of some bones causing me to
                have to retire from proffesional sports, however all this time gave me an oppurtunity to
                learn new skills such as:
